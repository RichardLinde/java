== Business exceptions

=== Use a common base class

* All business exceptions should inherit a common abstract base class so they can be distinguished from technical exceptions.
** Should be inheriting `RuntimeException`
** Should store the cause `Exception`
** Should contain a reason enum. The enum is project individual and contains values like `Conflict`, `NotFound` and `IncorrectInput`. This enum can later be used to decide how to inform the user about the problem e.g. via HTTP status codes when building REST apis.
