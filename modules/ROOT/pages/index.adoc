= Welcome to devon4j

devon4j is a collection of good practices and experiences when developing enterprise applications at scale.
By standardizing the development process and the usage of established frameworks and libraries devon4j aims to accelerate the ramp-up and onboarding phase.
At the same time using the existing experiences from experts reduces the risk to do known failures whilst increasing overall code quality.
