= RESTful Exception Handling

This article gives advice on a proper exception handling in the service layer.
It is important to catch all exceptions and map them to a meaningful result and not pass implementation details to the outside.
If not handled correct a generated error message is send to the client.

== Response messages for exceptions

An error response message contains the following information:

[cols="~,~,~"]
|===

| Response Header | HTTP status code | Status Code corresponding to the error

// .3+ = 3 row span
// .^ = vertical centered
.3+.^| Response body message 
| message
| A human-readable message describing the error

| code   
| A code identifying the concrete error

| uuid 
| An identifier (generally the correlation id) to help identify corresponding requests in logs

|===

== Exception Types

=== Security Exceptions

* Do not expose details of security exceptions in the body of the response 

[cols="~,~,~"]
|===

| Response Header | HTTP status code | 403 (FORBIDDEN)

.3+.^| Response body message 
| message
| "forbidden"

| code   
| `null`

| uuid 
| An identifier (generally the correlation id) to help identify corresponding requests in logs

|===


[TIP]
====

For debugging it makes sense to configure a parameter that allows returning the exception details on developer environments.
E.g.: adding a property that is false on default and when set to true the details are exposed. This must not be possible on the production environment.

====

=== Validation Exceptions

* Validation errors include *all* validation issues that do not fullfil the requirements, because it is a tedious work to figure out and fix all errors request by request.

[cols="~,~,~"]

.3+.^| Response body message 
| message
| All violated constraints.

| code

| uuid
